# Learning for Robotics Reading Group
Learning has become a major component of many robotics research areas such as perception, planning, localization, locomotion, and more. This reading group aims to keep participants up 
to date with the latest work happening in this domain. **Presented papers should at least have a real or simulated robot deployement components**.

## Logistics
- During the Fall term, we will meet on Fridays at 12:00 pm in hybrid format. For people attending in-person, we will meet in room J09 in building 6666 at Mila. For remote attendies, please use the zoom link available on the Mila Calender event.
- **Reading Group participates are expected to read each paper beforehand.**
- For any questions, please create an issue in this repo.

## Paper Presentation Instructions

### Volunteer to Present
- All participants are encouraged to volunteer to present at the reading group. 


- Volunteers can choose a paper from [this](suggested-papers.md) list of suggested papers, or any other paper that is 
related to learning for robotics. 


- To volunteer, please create an issue on this repo.


### Presentation Instructions
- Presentations should be limited to 40 minutes at most. The aim is to be done in 35-40 min to allow 15 min for general 
  discussion.


- Presentations should roughly adhere to the following outline:
  1. **5-10 minutes**: Problem setup and position to literature.
  2. **10-15 minutes**: Contributions/Novel technical points.
  3. **10-15 minutes**: Weak points, open questions, and future directions.
